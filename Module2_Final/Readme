In the program we have a known signal added to a unknown signal .
Then we use fft(Fast Fourier Transform) and its properties
to seperate and recover back the unknown signal in MATLAB Live Script.
This can be used when some known noise is getting added .
As we had not used built in functions it's a simple program 
and won't deal with very complicated noise signals.
